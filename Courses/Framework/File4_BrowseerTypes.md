# Handling Different Browser Types

DEBUGGING IS TWICE AS HARD AS WRITING THE
CODE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEREFORE, IF YOU
WRITE THE CODE AS CLEVERLY AS POSSIBLE, YOU
ARE, BY DEFINITION, NOT SMART ENOUGH TO DEBUG
IT.

Write a strongly-typed code, which you can do using **enum**  

Create browser type with enum and call them with its own class (may be browser)

# Automation Framework Development with Selenium Java

## What is an Automation Framework?
* In a simple sense, Automation Testing Framework is a way to organize the code as much as possible

That's it?

* BUT IT SHOULD BE 
    * Reusable
    * Scalable
    * Maintainable
    * Understandable
    * Workable

1. REUSABLE - A framework once written, should be used by multiple people across same or multiple
team meaning it should be used across **multiple** proiects, not limiting to one single
proiect
* Using framework one can reduce the effort spent on 'A' component (library of code)
which is **already** written or available

* Using the **existing** code (reusing the code) will require **less** or **no testing** since the
existing code is not new and its already in use.
